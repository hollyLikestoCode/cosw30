    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>My name is Holly Nahigyan and I am a Web Development student at Long Beach City College.
    Prior to starting the Web Dev program at LBCC I had essentially no experience with coding. 
    However, I've found coding to be a challenging and rewarding endeavor.</p>
    <p>Here's a link to my <a href="https://github.com/hollyLikestoCode" target="_blank">GitHub Prolie</a></p>
    <p>Outside of my academic interests I enjoy hiking, cooking and working out. I mainly hike around the Angeles National Forest and go about once every week or two.
    I love to cook all types of recipes and cusines. Lately, I've been trying to eat better and have been making primarily vegetarian at home.</p>
